#This is a implementation of CNN on MNIST using MATLAB


##Two methods are used to finish the task: 

* Build all the network by hand(Run main.m to see the result)
* Build a network based on the MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox(Run dlt.m to see the result)

The convolutional network has 2 convolutional layers and two meanpooling layers.
