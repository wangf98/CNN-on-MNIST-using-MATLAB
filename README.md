This is a implementation of CNN on MNIST using MATLAB
===

Two methods are used to finish the task: 
---
#1. Build all the network by hand(Run main.m to see the result)
#2. Build a network based on the MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox(Run dlt.m to see the result)

The convolutional network has 2 convolutional layers and two meanpooling layers.
